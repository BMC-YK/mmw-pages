      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction/Background:</h2>
      <p>
        Safe drinking water is a fundamental right, yet many Native American
        communities struggle to ensure water quality. Research indicates serious
        health risks from contaminants, such as lead for instance, which can
        lead to developmental disorders and increased cancer risks [1]. The
        "2021 Report to the Congress of the United States on Sanitation
        Deficiencies for Indian Homes and Communities" reveals many tribal
        households lack reliable access to clean water, heightening public
        health concerns [2]. Environmental health initiatives emphasize urgent
        need for improved water, with continued posed risks [3]. Our data set
        consists of, the USGS National Water Information System (NWIS), the
        Water Quality Portal, and many more cross referenced with tribal water
        dependency locations using the Bureau of Indian Affairs resources to
        assess geographic areas.
      </p>
      <h2 id="problem-definition">Problem Definition:</h2>
      <p>
        The absence of effective predictive tools for water quality damages the
        ability of Native American communities and policymakers to respond to
        contamination events. Traditional monitoring methods often fail to
        provide timely alerts about rising pollutant levels, resulting in
        delayed responses, threatening public health, and highlighting the need
        for technological solutions enhancing water safety.
      </p>
      <p>
        This proposal aims to develop a machine learning model using neural
        networks to predict levels of specific water pollutants in sources
        relied upon by Native American communities. By leveraging historical
        data and environmental variables, the model seeks to identify trends and
        potential spikes in contamination. Such capabilities will empower
        communities to take proactive measures, reducing health risks, and
        thereby improving the overall well-being of the populations.

      <h2 id="preprocessing">Data Preprocessing Methods:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Cleaning</strong>: Removing duplicate entries is
          essential so the model learns from varied examples. Duplicates can
          mislead the training process, resulting in inaccurate predictions
          about water quality.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Normalization</strong>: This step adjusts all data features to
          a similar scale. It prevents any one factor, like a particular
          pollutant, from overly influencing the model’s predictions, leading to
          more balanced and accurate forecasts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Splitting</strong>: The dataset is divided into training
          and testing portions. This allows us to evaluate how well the model
          performs on new, unseen data. Quick and reliable predictions on water
          quality are crucial for communities to respond effectively to
          potential health risks.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 id="models">ML Algorithms/Models:</h2>
      <li>
        <strong>Decision Trees</strong>: Using a simple and intuitive approach,
        this model helps capture complex relationships between various factors
        affecting water quality. Its straightforward setup saves time, allowing
        us to focus on refining its accuracy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Random Forest</strong>: This model enhances prediction accuracy
        and minimizes errors by considering multiple decision trees. It also
        helps identify which factors are most significant in affecting water
        quality, guiding effective pollution control measures.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Neural Networks</strong>: By using advanced techniques, we can
        build models that improve as more data is added. These networks are
        particularly good at understanding complicated relationships between
        pollutants and environmental conditions, leading to better predictions
        and faster community responses.
      </li>
      <h2 id="potential">(Potential) Results and Discussion:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>R-squared (R²)</strong>: Aim for R² ≥ 0.8, indicating the
          model explains at least 80% of the variability in toxin levels.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)</strong>: Target RMSE < 10 µg/L
          for pollutants to demonstrate robust predictive capabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mean Absolute Error (MAE)</strong>: Achieve MAE < 5 µg/L for
          heavy metals like lead and arsenic, ensuring predictive accuracy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enhance Local Monitoring Capacity</strong>: Localizing the
          model will empower communities to engage in ongoing water quality
          monitoring and decision-making.
